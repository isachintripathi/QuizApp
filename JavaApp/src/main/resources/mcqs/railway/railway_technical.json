    "options": ["Solar energy", "Wind energy", "Nuclear energy", "Geothermal energy"],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,

    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "In a DC series motor, the speed is inversely proportional to the flux, which is directly proportional to the current. When the load increases, the current increases, resulting in an increase in flux, which causes a decrease in speed.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A turbocharger in a diesel engine is used to increase power output by forcing more air into the combustion chamber. It uses the energy from the exhaust gases to drive a turbine that compresses the intake air, allowing more fuel to be burned and thus generating more power.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The direction of rotation of a three-phase induction motor can be reversed by interchanging any two phases of the supply. This changes the phase sequence, which in turn reverses the direction of the rotating magnetic field and consequently the direction of rotation of the motor.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Young's modulus, also known as the elastic modulus, is a measure of the stiffness of a solid material. It is defined as the ratio of stress (force per unit area) to strain (proportional deformation), and thus has units of N/m² or Pascal (Pa).",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "In India, the broad gauge (1676 mm) is used for high-speed trains. The Indian Railways primarily operates on broad gauge tracks, which allow for higher speeds and greater stability compared to narrower gauges.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Ballast is the layer of crushed stone or gravel that forms the bed on which railway sleepers (ties) are laid. Its main function is to provide support and stability to the track, distribute the load from the sleepers, assist in drainage, and prevent the growth of vegetation. It also helps in limiting the longitudinal and lateral movement of the track.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "A transformer works on the principle of Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a conductor. In a transformer, the alternating current in the primary winding creates a changing magnetic field, which induces an EMF in the secondary winding.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "In a four-stroke diesel engine, compression ignition occurs during the power stroke (third stroke). During the compression stroke (second stroke), air is compressed to high pressure and temperature. At the end of the compression stroke, fuel is injected, which ignites due to the high temperature of the compressed air, and the expansion of the burning gases drives the piston down during the power stroke.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "An air compressor in a diesel-electric locomotive is primarily used to provide compressed air for the braking system. The compressed air is used to operate the air brakes on the locomotive and the train. It is also used for other pneumatic systems such as horns, bells, and sometimes door operations.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The maximum permissible speed of a train on a curved track primarily depends on the radius of the curve and the applied cant (superelevation). A larger radius and appropriate cant allow for higher speeds by counteracting the centrifugal force experienced by the train while negotiating the curve.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "In a typical automatic signaling system on railways, the sequence of operations is: (1) Track circuit detection - the presence of a train is detected by the track circuit, (2) Signal aspect change - the signal behind the train changes to red and the ones ahead change according to the block occupancy, (3) Train movement - the train proceeds based on the signal aspects it encounters.",
