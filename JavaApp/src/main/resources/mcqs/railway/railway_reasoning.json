    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "In the given code, each letter of the word is replaced by the letter that comes before it in the English alphabet, and the entire word is then reversed. So, T → S, E → D, R → Q, etc., then reversed. Similarly, for RAILWAY: R → Q, A → Z, I → H, L → K, W → V, A → Z, Y → X. This gives XZAVKIHQ, which when reversed gives QHIKVAZX.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
    "explanation": "The lady is the maternal grandmother of the nephew, which means she is the mother of the nephew's mother. Since the nephew is the child of the man's sibling, and the man has only one sister, the nephew must be the child of this sister.

Initially, Rohit's position from right = n + 1 - 7 = n - 6. After interchanging, Rohit's position from right = 12 and position from left = 22. So, 12 + 22 - 1 = n. This gives n = 33.",

Let's try the next rule: each letter is replaced by the letter that comes after it in the English alphabet. P → Q, A → B, S → T, etc. So, PASSENGER is coded as QBTTFOHFS.",

    "options": ["30", "36", "45", "60"],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Let the initial number of men be m and the initial number of women be w. Given that w = m/2. After the changes, (m - 10) = (w + 5). Substituting, m - 10 = m/2 + 5, which gives m/2 = 15, so m = 30. Thus, w = 15. The total number of passengers initially = m + w = 30 + 15 = 45.",
