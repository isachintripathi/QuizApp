    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Let the principal be P and rate be R%. After 4 years, P + (P×R×4)/100 = 1440 and after 5 years, P + (P×R×5)/100 = 1620. The difference is (P×R)/100 = 1620 - 1440 = 180. Now, after 4 years, P + 4×180 = 1440, so P = 1440 - 720 = ₹1,200.",

    "options": ["516 km", "628 km", "702 km", "756 km"],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Let the distance between stations A and B be x km. Let the first train travel y km before meeting. Then, the second train has traveled (x - y) km. Given, (x - y) - y = 48, so x - 2y = 48. Also, time taken is the same for both trains, so y/54 = (x - y)/48. Solving, 48y = 54(x - y), or 48y = 54x - 54y, giving 102y = 54x. Substituting in x - 2y = 48, we get x - 2(54x/102) = 48, which gives x - (108x/102) = 48, so (102x - 108x)/102 = 48, or -6x/102 = 48, giving x = -48 × 102/6 = -816.
