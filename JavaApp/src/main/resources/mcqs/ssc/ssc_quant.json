    "options": ["20%", "25%", "30%", "35%"],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Let the cost price of each article be ₹x. The cost price of 20 articles = 20x. The selling price of 16 articles = 16y, where y is the selling price of each article. Given that 20x = 16y, so y = 20x/16 = 5x/4. Profit percent = ((y-x)/x) × 100 = ((5x/4-x)/x) × 100 = (x/4) × 100 = 25%.",
