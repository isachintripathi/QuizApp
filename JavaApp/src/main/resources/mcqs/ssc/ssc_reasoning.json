    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "The code follows this pattern: each letter is shifted by its position in the original word (starting from 1). For MOUSE: M (1st letter) → shift by 1 → N → P (shift by 2 in another direction). O (2nd letter) → shift by 2 → Q → R (shift by 1 in another direction). And so on. For KEYBOARD: K → shift by 1 → L → M (shift by 1). E → shift by 2 → G → D (shift by 3). And so on. This gives MDZCPYRD.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Given that A is sitting on one of the ends, and B is sitting next to A but not next to C, we can have two possibilities for A, B: either A, B or B, A. Also, E is sitting next to C, so we have C, E or E, C. Since B is not next to C, the arrangement must be A, B, D, C, E or A, B, D, E, C or E, C, D, B, A or C, E, D, B, A.

    "explanation": "The relationship is: 36 = 6² and 49 = 7². The difference between 6 and 7 is 1. Similarly, 64 = 8² and the next number should be 9² = 81. However, 100 = 10² is also a possibility if the relationship is different. Checking further, 6² : 7² :: 8² : 10². This doesn't seem to follow a pattern. Let's try another approach: 36 + 13 = 49 and 64 + ? = 100. So ? = 36, which doesn't match the pattern. The most logical relationship is that these are squares of consecutive numbers: 6², 7², 8², 9². So the answer is 81.",
