    "explanation": "The period of a simple pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g). Since the period is proportional to 1/√g, and g on the Moon is 1/6 that on Earth, the period on the Moon would be √6 times the period on Earth, which is approximately 2.45 seconds. The closest answer is 4.9 seconds, but that's actually incorrect - it should be closer to 2√6 ≈ 4.9 seconds.",
