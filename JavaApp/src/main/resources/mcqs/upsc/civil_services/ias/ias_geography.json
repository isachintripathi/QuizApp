    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "There are three main types of plate boundaries: Convergent (where plates move toward each other), Divergent (where plates move away from each other), and Transform (where plates slide past each other horizontally). 'Rotational' is not a recognized type of plate boundary in plate tectonics theory.",

      "Preserves direction but distorts shape",
      "Preserves distance between all points"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection that preserves angles and shapes of small objects (making it conformal) but significantly distorts the size of objects near the poles. This makes it useful for navigation but problematic for understanding the true relative sizes of land masses.",

      "They rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Tropical cyclones do not gain strength over land masses; rather, they rapidly weaken after making landfall due to increased surface friction and the loss of warm water energy source. They require warm ocean waters (typically above 26-27°C) to form and maintain their strength.",

    "explanation": "The Von Thünen Model, developed by Johann Heinrich von Thünen in 1826, is a theoretical model that explains agricultural land use patterns around a central market city. It proposes that land use is determined by land rent and transportation costs, with more profitable and transport-sensitive crops being grown closer to the market.",

    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Katabatic winds are cold, dense air masses that flow downslope under the influence of gravity. They occur when the air on a high elevation surface, such as a mountain, plateau, or glacier, is cooled by radiation cooling.
