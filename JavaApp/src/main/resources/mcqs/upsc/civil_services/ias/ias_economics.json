    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,

In monopolistic competition, firms sell similar but slightly differentiated products, allowing them to have some price-setting ability.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "When the central bank increases the money supply, the LM (Liquidity Preference-Money Supply) curve shifts rightward. This is because the LM curve represents equilibrium in the money market, and an increase in money supply leads to lower interest rates at each level of income, causing the rightward shift.",

    "explanation": "The Keynesian theory of income determination is based on the fundamental psychological law of the diminishing marginal propensity to consume.

    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,

    "explanation": "A liquidity trap is a situation in which conventional monetary policy becomes ineffective because nominal interest rates are at or near zero. In this situation, people prefer holding cash rather than securities, making it difficult for the central bank to stimulate the economy through interest rate reductions, as they cannot go significantly below zero.",
